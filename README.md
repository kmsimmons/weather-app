This is an example of a working 'weather app.'

To use this project...

1. First, you'll have to create your own account to generate an API key (I'm using the free option) from https://openweathermap.org/

2. Clone the project https://github.com/kmsimmons/weather-app.git

3. CD into project folder

4. Yarn/npm install

5. Yarn/npm start

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
